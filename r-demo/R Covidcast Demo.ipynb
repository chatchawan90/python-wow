COVIDcast provides daily access to a range of COVID-related signals, from sources like symptom surveys and medical claims data, as well as standard signals such as confirmed cases and deaths. To run a cell, either press the green play button in the top right corner or press Cmd + Shift + Enter with your cursor in the cell.\n",
